    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Joanne! I'm a junior double majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive & Brain Sciences at Tufts University.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the Computer Science side, I am interested in gaining more experience in modern software engineering practices as well as continuing to improve my web development skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the Cognitive & Brain Sciences side, I enjoy philosophical discussions on topics such as language, consciousness, epistemology, religion, and more. Here's an <a href="https://nespectator.org/the-quandry-of-mind-for-materialism/">opinion piece</a> I wrote for The New England Spectator, a campus journal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of school, I also enjoy <a href="https://youtu.be/yJMcghmKqu4">singing</a>, playing the piano, photography, learning languages, and reading (recently I finished <em>The Master and Margarita</em> by Mikhail Bulgakov).
    </p>
